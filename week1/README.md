# Rust course - Week 1 exercise

Please implement a version of the [guessing game from the Rust book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html), but where the secret number is between 1 and 10, and where guesses can be given in either numerical format (1, 5, 220 etc) or text ("one" through "ten").

As a bonus, run clippy and try to implement any suggested improvements
